# Pruning Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains code for analysis of various pruning methods.
The code is written in PyTorch, including the built-in pruning methods.

## Project Structure
- Iterative pruning is implemented in `iterative_pruning.py`.
- One-shot pruning is implemented in `one_shot_pruning.py`.
- Base model learning loop and evaluation is implemented in `base_workflow.ipynb`.
- Visualizations and results are stored in `validate_models.ipynb`.
- Utility directory contains code for training, evaluation, saving... of the models.
